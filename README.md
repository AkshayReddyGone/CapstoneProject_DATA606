# CapstoneProject_DATA606
"Predicting Air Quality and Pollution Levels Using Machine Learning" is my Master's capstone project in Data Science. The goal is to develop a predictive model using historical data and meteorological factors to forecast air quality. The model will help identify trends, detect pollution peaks, and assist in data-driven decision-making.
